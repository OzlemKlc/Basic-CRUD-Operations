# Basic-CRUD-Operations

This README file contains step-by-step instructions for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## 1. Introduction

This project was created to gain a basic understanding of managing data in a database. Below are the steps on how to perform CRUD operations.

## 2. Installation

1. **Database**: First you will need to create a database. Create a database according to the database management system you want to use (for example, MSSQL was used in the project).

2. **Connection Settings**: Configure the required settings for database connection. These settings are usually found in a configuration file or environment variables.

3. **Application**: Create an application to perform CRUD operations. This application will contain codes that will communicate with the database.

## 3. CRUD Operations

### 3.1. Create

- Using the `SELECT` SQL statement, you can read the data by filtering or retrieving all.

### 3.3. Update

To update existing data:

- You can update existing data using the `UPDATE` SQL statement.

### 3.4. Delete

To delete data from the database:

- You can delete specific data using the `DELETE` SQL statement.


This sample README file was written to provide guidance on basic CRUD operations. You may need to customize some details based on your project and the technology used.
